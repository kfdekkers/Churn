# Objective
Predict behavior to retain customers. You can analyze all relevant customer data and develop focused customer retention programs.

# Preparation
* Set random seed
* Load libraries
* Set working directory
* Load data
```{r, message=F, warning=F}
set.seed(123)

library(ggplot2)
library(caret)
library(gbm)
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)

setwd("C:/Users/kfdek/Dropbox/Documents/R/Churn")

data <- read.csv("WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv")
```

## Data exploration
```{r}
str(data)
summary(data)
prop.table(table(data$Churn))
```

## Data clean-up
* Remove customerID
* Convert SeniorCitizen to factor variable
```{r}
data <- data[, !colnames(data) == "customerID"]
data$SeniorCitizen <- factor(data$SeniorCitizen)
```

## Missing data
* Usual options: Impute missing values, remove rows with missing values, use model that can handle missing values
* Alternative: Remove feature TotalCharges which has all the missing data, because it is tenure * MonthlyCharges
```{r}
round(cor(data$tenure * data$MonthlyCharges, data$TotalCharges, 
          use = "pairwise.complete.obs"), 3)
ggplot(data, aes(x = TotalCharges,  y = tenure * MonthlyCharges)) + 
  geom_point(color = "blue4")
data <- data[, !colnames(data) == "TotalCharges"]
```

## Sanity Checks
* Calculate some tables of features with expected overlap
* Plot some expected relationships
```{r}
with(data, table(InternetService, OnlineSecurity))
with(data, table(PhoneService, MultipleLines))
ggplot(data, aes(x = Contract, y = tenure)) + geom_boxplot(color = "blue4")
```

# Analysis plan
## Preprocessing
* Scale data (mean = 0, sd = 1) to ensure features with high range of values do not dominate

## Model parameters
* Use decision tree model
    + Has integrated feature selection
    + Tree provides insights in how selected features determine churn rate
* Use classification accuracy instead of ROC/AUC as training metric
    + Labels of Churn are fairly balanced
    + No preference for rate of true positives and false positives
* Use 10 fold cross-validation

## Evaluation
* Compare test set accuracy and feature importance with logistic regression baseline model and strong gradient boosting model

# Run models
## Split data in train and test sets using balanced split
```{r}
split <- createDataPartition(data$Churn, p = 0.3, list = F)
train <- data[-split, ]
test <- data[split, ]
```

## Baseline logistic regression model
```{r}
fit <- train(Churn ~ ., data = train, method = "glm", preProcess = c("center", "scale"), 
             trControl = trainControl(method = "cv"))
paste("Accuracy:", round(sum(test$Churn == predict(fit, test)) / nrow(test), 3))
varImp(fit)
```

## Baseline logistic regression model 2
* Remove correlated features to fix rank-deficiency warning
```{r}
fit <- train(Churn ~ ., data = train, method = "glm", preProcess = c("center", "scale", "corr"), 
             trControl = trainControl(method = "cv"))
paste("Accuracy:", round(sum(test$Churn == predict(fit, test)) / nrow(test), 3))
varImp(fit)
```

## Strong gradient boosting model
```{r}
fit <- train(Churn ~ ., data = train, method = "gbm", preProcess = c("center", "scale"), 
             trControl = trainControl(method = "cv"), verbose = F)
paste("Accuracy:", round(sum(test$Churn == predict(fit, test)) / nrow(test), 3))
varImp(fit)
```

## Decision tree model
```{r}
fit <- train(Churn ~ ., data = train, method = "rpart", preProcess = c("center", "scale"), 
             trControl = trainControl(method = "cv"))
paste("Accuracy:", round(sum(test$Churn == predict(fit, test)) / nrow(test), 3))
varImp(fit)
```

## Decision tree model 2
* Remove scaling to get non-scaled rules
    + For models where scaling is important an alternative is to scale predictions back to original mean and sd instead of removing preprocessing
```{r}
fit <- train(Churn ~ ., data = train, method = "rpart", trControl = trainControl(method = "cv"))
paste("Accuracy:", round(sum(test$Churn == predict(fit, test)) / nrow(test), 3))
varImp(fit)
```

## Data visualization
* Plot tree
* Plot relationships between Churn and features
```{r}
rpart.plot(fit$finalModel, type = 5, cex = 1, box.palette = "BuRd")

ggplot(data, aes(x = PaymentMethod, y = ..prop.., group = Churn, fill = Churn)) + 
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") + scale_fill_manual(values = c("blue4", "firebrick1"))

ggplot(data, aes(x = Churn, y = tenure)) + geom_boxplot(color = "blue4")

ggplot(data, aes(x = InternetService, y = ..prop.., group = Churn, fill = Churn)) + 
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") + scale_fill_manual(values = c("blue4", "firebrick1"))
```

## Save data
```{r}
save(data, fit, test, file = "data.RData")
```

## Customer retention strategies
* Target customers that pay with electronic checks
* Target customers that have a tenure < 27 that pay with electronic checks
* Target customers that have fiber optic internet service, a tenure < 27 and pay with electronic checks

## Future improvements
* Ask data generators/curators if SeniorCitizen label 1 corresponds to customer being a senior citizen
* Ask data generators/curators why TotalCharges differs a little bit from tenure * MonthlyCharges
* Improve decision tree
    + evaluate bootstrapping instead of cross-validation
    + evaluate parameters for splitting
    + evaluate parameters for pruning
* Improve visualizations and app
* Secondary objective: Improve prediction of customers that might churn at the cost of minor increase in false positives (and decreased accuracy) using ROC/AUC
